# Lua-Aim-Trainer
![](/docs/screenshot.png?raw=true)

A crude and bare bones making of an aim trainer coded the programming language Lua and used the [Love2D Game Engine](https://github.com/love2d/love). It was made as a meme but I do use it regularly right before CS:GO or Valorant matches so you might as well give it a try.
